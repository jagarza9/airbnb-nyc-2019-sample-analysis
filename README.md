# airbnb-nyc-2019-sample-analysis
Data analysis of Sample Airbnb NYC 2019 using Python and Tableau
## ðŸ“Œ Business Questions & Key Insights (NYC 2019)

### 1) Which boroughs/neighbourhoods have the highest average nightly price?
- **Top Boroughs (avg price):** Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens.  
- **Top Neighbourhoods (â‰¥100 listings):** Tribeca, Gramercy, Midtown, Arverne, Financial District.  
- **Evidence:** `reports/figures/borough_avg_price.png`, `data/processed/borough_price_stats.csv`  
- *Note:* Rankings use mean price and exclude extreme outliers (top 1%).

### 2) How does room type impact price and availability?
- **Price gap:** *Entire home/apt* averages **~2â€“3Ã—** the price of *Private room*.  
- **Availability:** Highâ€‘price and lowâ€‘price listings appear across the full availability rangeâ€”no clear link between price and `availability_365`.  
- **Business takeaways:**  
  - *Travelers:* Private rooms = best budget value with wide availability.  
  - *Hosts:* Entire home/apt maximizes nightly revenue, but may book fewer nights.  
- **Evidence:** `reports/figures/room_type_share.png`, optional box/scatter by room type.

### 3) Whatâ€™s the relationship between number_of_reviews and price?
- **Insight:** No strong linear relationshipâ€”budget listings tend to accumulate more reviews; luxury listings fewer.  
- **(Optional) Add the number:** Pearson r = **`<fill_after_analysis>`**.  
- **Evidence:** `reports/figures/price_vs_reviews.png`.

### 4) Which neighbourhoods are the top priced (with sufficient listings)?
- **Premium (>$150):** e.g., **Hellâ€™s Kitchen** and other Manhattan cores (high convenience/attractions).  
- **Midâ€‘range ($100â€“130):** **Williamsburg, Harlem** (strong demand, diverse supply).  
- **Budget (<$100):** **Bedfordâ€‘Stuyvesant, Bushwick** (popular with younger travelers).  
- **Method:** Ranked by mean price with a **min 100 listings** threshold to avoid smallâ€‘sample noise.  
- **Evidence:** `reports/figures/price_box_by_borough.png`, `data/processed/top_neighbourhoods_by_avg_price.csv`.

### ðŸ§ª Methods & Assumptions (short)
- Columns standardized; dates/numerics coerced; malformed rows skipped.  
- Prices trimmed at the **99th percentile** to reduce outlier distortion.  
- Analyses based on **NYC 2019** snapshot from InsideAirbnb; results reflect that period only.
